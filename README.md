The code challenge scope completely changed on me a few hrs before I planned on submitting.
I would have focused a lot more on the frontend.

Things I wanted to do:

Use GraphQl Fragments on my front-end to better manage my cache. I wouldnâ€™t normally pass this many props around.
Update the cache on mutations.
Use the connect method for pagination and add filters.
Write tests front end and backend using jest/enzyme.
type checking using typescript.
Refactor components to be more reusable.
Add images and change the ColorContext to fit Hilton better.
Add Animations for all lists.
Error handling

```
